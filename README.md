# Brief Explanation of the Project:

In this project, my role as an AI developer was to design an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. The agent, representing a pirate, needed to navigate through a game world with pathways and obstacles to find the treasure before the human player. The primary task was to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm for the NPC pirate.

The starter code provided a foundation for the game environment, including the representation of the game world, pathways, obstacles, and the treasure. Additionally, it included basic functionalities for the pirate agent to move within the environment. However, the code lacked the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm, which was my responsibility to design and integrate.

I created code to implement the deep Q-learning algorithm, defining the state space, action space, reward system, and the neural network architecture to approximate the Q-values. The training process involved the exploration and exploitation balance, where the agent learned to make optimal decisions based on the current state to maximize cumulative rewards.

# Connection to Computer Science:

Computer Scientists and Problem Solving:
Computer scientists are like tech wizards who specialize in creating fancy step-by-step instructions for computers (called algorithms), making cool computer programs, and solving tricky computer problems. In this project, I used my knack for solving problems to build a smart game character that knows how to move around in the game world. I taught it using a special learning method called deep Q-learning, which is like training it to make smart decisions. To do this, I needed to really understand how computer instructions work, the basics of machine learning, and how to write code in a smart and efficient way. It's like creating a high-tech solution for making our game character super smart and good at finding treasures.

Approach to Problem Solving:
When dealing with problems, I tackled them step by step, like following a recipe. First, I broke down the big problem into smaller parts, like figuring out the rules and actions needed. Then, I used a method called Q-learning, kind of like a smart way of learning from experience. I also made sure the brain of the solution, called the neural network, worked as efficiently as possible. It was like experimenting with a recipe, making adjustments until everything worked just right.


Ethical Responsibilities:
Considering players and the company, it's important to be fair and make the game enjoyable for everyone. This means making sure the game is not too hard or biased, and being clear about how the AI is used. Also, respecting players' privacy and following rules about keeping their data safe is crucial.

The game's AI should treat all players fairly. The pirate character in the game shouldn't have an unfair advantage, and the game should be fun for people with different skill levels.

We need to be open about how the AI works so players can understand it. If something unexpected happens or there are problems, we need to fix them quickly and let everyone know what's going on. Being transparent and accountable is key.
